# Recipes!

To add a recipe:

- make a new markdown file (`recipe_name.md`) in the `source` folder.
- Look at the `apple_cake.md` file for ideal formatting.
- The first line should have the title of the recipe that will be extracted to the main page. It should begin with `# ` (a single pound sign and a space). This is an "H1" in HTML (the biggest header size).
- After that, put ingredients and steps with two pound signs to denote "h2" fields in HTML. (Smaller headers.)
- Use `-` (minus, hyphen) for list items. Again this should be pretty easy. Separate new paragraphs by multiple newlines.

Markdown is easier to write for most people than HTML. So this converts recipes in markdown to HTML and deploys them to [my recipe site](https://recipes.thiedefamily.org).
