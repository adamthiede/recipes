# Recipes!

To add a recipe:

- make a new markdown file (`recipe_name.md`) in the `src` folder.
- Look at the `apple_cake.md` file for ideal formatting.
- The first line should have the title of the recipe that will be extracted to the main page. It should begin with `# ` (a single pound sign and a space). This is an "H1" in HTML (the biggest header size).
- After that, put ingredients and steps with two pound signs to denote "h2" fields in HTML. (Smaller headers.)
- Use `-` (minus, hyphen) for list items. Again this should be pretty easy. Separate new paragraphs by multiple newlines.
